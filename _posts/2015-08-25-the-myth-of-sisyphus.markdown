> We live on the future: "tomorrow", "later on", "when you have made your way", "you will understand when you are old enough". Such irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it's a matter of dying. Yet, a time comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty. Thus he asserts his youth. But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time and, by the horror that seizes him, he recognises his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. - Albert Camus
