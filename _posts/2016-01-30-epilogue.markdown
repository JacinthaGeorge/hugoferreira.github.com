*What if…*

> What and if, two words as nonthreatening as words come. But put them together side-by-side and they have the power to haunt you for the rest of your life: What if?...

Sixteen days have been passed since you made your mind about leaving her. By this time, you still didn't mustered the courage to write down the exact words — or somehow those that you *remember* — that were said in that afternoon. Maybe because, once again, even if every fibre of your being was completely decided that *that* was the only possible path, if kept, as always, hope that the world would show you that things could be different. And, in a last breath of hope, you let — you *forced* — to be her the one to say aloud what both knew to be the purpose of that meeting, that day, that conversation, that last embrace. There is no place to *pride* in the game of love, that the only way for you to approach the certainty that you were looking for was, *one last time*, to put in her hands the decision of both your fates.

And since then those words hunt your days, your dreams, your unconscious mind. You recurrently ponder every hypothesis, every past decisions were things could have been different. If, at least, at *that* time, at *that* point, when she said what she has said, *you* had reacted differently. If you had tried to be more understanding, more tolerant, less worried, more disconnected... If you've had the courage, or the patience, of *giving time to time*...

That sentence that you hate so much. That phrase that seems to be agains everything that defines you, that defines what you've learned to be in the last decades, so against the human condition. Time, our worst enemy, simultaneously the source of our existence — no one exists as an *immutable being* — and our doom. In the words of Albert Camus:

> We live on the future: “tomorrow”, “later on”, “when you have made your way”, “you will understand when you are old enough”. Such irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it’s a matter of dying. Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty. Thus he asserts his youth. But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognises his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it.

What yet, without time, there is no hope, since:

> A man devoid of hope and conscious of being so has ceased to belong to the future.

And from this realization, *aware* or not, your mind decided to do what, everyday, it does best: *analyze* the situation, *ponder* the alternatives, *create* solutions, *test* hypothesis; if the solution doesn't work, if the hypothesis is wrong, then one simply has to backtrack, to ponder where it went wrong, to look for the detail that eluded us; because something eluded us... something *always* eludes us:

> Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.

And if it's really necessary, then you scratch everything, you throw all away, and start from the beginning! Yet another reaction that comes from easy to you, something that would scare so much people, or regarded as a complete waste. But not you; you never hesitate in throwing aways hundreds of hours of work. Why? Because nothing is lost: nothing is *ever* lost! You *always* keep something... the experience of failing, the knowledge of what doesn't work, the intuition that lead you to join the point A with B with C... *but missing some point along the path*; the frustration that keeps you moving, and the tenacity that there is no problem that cannot be solved... because the solution always existed — *somewhere* — and if it is out of your reach, it's because *you, and only you*, don't possess the *skill* to find it. The responsibility always feels down over the one and same person, and you've learned — or *today you choose* — that there's no gain in sharing it with others. You are, simultaneously, the victim, judge and executioner of your own failures.

And effectively, nothing is lost... your day-to-day experimental laboratory is so free of effects, that trying, by the *sheer attempt* of merely trying, is such a common course of action and borders stupidity. So common that you've learned not to measure the consequences, to not ponder deeply about what may happen if you are proven wrong. You create the perfect testing environment, and isolate from the outside world any effect due to your guesses and intuitions. If you cannot rigorously calculate the solution to a problem, then you never hesitate to use that amalgamation of experience accumulated throughout the years, that storm of electricity and chemistry in your mind, that emerge, in the blink of an eye, casuistically selected heuristics by those times they worked; and if, epistemologically, you dedicate your life to the search of the *truth*, positivistic and *exact*, whatever works ninety percent of the time you find it, in practice, more than *acceptable*.

And in that process if forget chance, the uncontrollable variables, the scenarios where, by throwing the dice so *many times*, even the oddest and most improbable outcomes will eventually happen. You forget one of the effects that you know so well, that you reject so many times in your analysis, that makes you always double when things are too good to be truth: *serendipity*... sometimes, the universe really seems to conspire in order to make those improbable things happen. But you know that it's not a *conspiration*; you know *nothing happens by change*; and although you also know that you don't give the same meaning to that phrase that *poets* and *dreamers* do — that there is a deliberate reason, an hidden driving force, a conscious agency that posits the meaning of things — you well acquainted with the fundamentals of mathematics and physics, of cause and effect, of the *meta-determinism* that exists in a quantic universe ruled by probabilistic laws, to know that *not even chance happens by chance*.

> And here are trees and I know their gnarled surface, water and I feel its taste. These scents of grass and stars at night, certain evenings when the heart relaxes — how shall I negate this world whose power and strength I feel? Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. You describe it to me and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are true. You take apart its mechanism and my hope increases. At the final stage you teach me that this wondrous and multicolored universe can be reduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the electron. All this is good and I wait for you to continue. But you tell me of an invisible planetary system in which electrons gravitate around a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image. I realize then that you have been reduced to poetry: I shall never know.


But because it's in your nature to unveil those hidden variables, to seek the hidden *alpha* and *omega*; because you reject dissonance and ambivalence; because you do not accept what you can't understand, your mind wanders throughout those processes every night while you sleep; every moment while you decide to let go — where you *forget to keep* - the control over your thoughts. And it wanders *always* to the same subject, the same events, the same persons...

What you don't understand is there isn't the possibility of control. There is no variables to be found. *There is no equation to solve*. Everything is too complex, too interconnected, too vast. Meaningless as you are, you wish to understand *universes inside universes*, and by a sheer act of *arrogance* you even think it to be possible.

*What if...*

But life isn't made of that stuff; because if you think carefully, if you observe yourself writing down this text, if you think in the long sequence of actions, in the cause and effect that leas to the existence of tens of thousands of words dedicated to someone you hardly understood — someone that was possible nothing more that the *idealization* of your own mind — you'll see that control is a mere illusion, and any attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible, that the neverending quest for the meaning of life and the sensations that make us happy, are the ultimate acts that impede us from being so:

> Tu ne seras jamais heureux si tu continues à chercher en quoi consiste le bonheur. Et tu ne vivras jamais si tu recherches le sens de la vie. [^2]

[^2]: You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

What is left to us then, mere humans, also incapable of controlling that arrow of time dictated by entropy?...

*Choice...*

*The choice*, free of every and any illusion of consequence and meaning. We are not able of controlling the world or the people that surround us. We cannot bend reality by our sheer will. But we are — *we believe to be?* — able to choose.

And so you did it: in each moment, in each feeling of pain and joy, of anguish and hope, of frustration or happiness, you made a choice. Would you believe in *free will*, and you would be questioning if they were *the right choices*. But you know very well that's just another illusion; an illusion that you decided to rebel since childhood, but an illusion *nonetheless*. And so, you realize that your only available choices, given who you were and the information you had and those particular moments, were, precisely, the ones you took. It doesn't matter if you were wrong of right; all it matters is that, would everything happen again, and you would have made exactly the same thing, just like a movie played by the umpteenth time over a screen.

> Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward that lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain. It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks towards the lair of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock.

And you obviously rebel yourself against it... Just one more action that only and *absurdist* could take. You revolt against the inevitable, against the unavoidable, against the incomprehensible... You revolt against yourself. You find irritating that every — *every* — single morning you awake, the first thought you have once you gain conscience is always — *always* — the same: her. You revolt against yourself everytime the phone rings, that you receive a message, that you open *Facebook*... You revolt against yourself by the absurdity of the situation, for rationally knowing there is only one path to take — only one *choice* to make — and that any other that you might ponder is doomed to fail because *you are not in the control of the situation*. You aren't now, you never were, you'll never be. It's not *supposed* to. It's not even *desirable* to.

You revolt because your life is all about solving equations and ***she's not and equation that you can solve. It's not an expression you can understand. Not pages that you can scrutinize. Not symbols that you can unveils or a lexicum that you can learn. She's a complete world, with her mountains and valleys; her rivers and oceans; her continents and islands; her secrets and mysteries. A whole with its various languages, and alphabets, and books, and histories, and characters, and *** **endless dreams** ***kept within*** **herself**.

And *you* are another one of those worlds...

Two planets; *two bodies* that approached each other, whose gravity mutually influenced your own trajectory, that made in dance in elliptic curves around a common axis, facing one another, in rapid tangential movements of angular acceleration due to the sheer amount of mass that comprises your beings. But whose origins, whose past, whose genesis of your own structures, your own *momentum*, partially dictated even before you were both born, was too strong for those brief moments where *nothing else existed* besides you.

And that now depart due to the action of the same force that once attracted you... maybe looking into each other, taking with you whatever you *choose* to take. While one of you, incapable of forgetting all the wonders that were seen and felt in such a different, such fascinating, such strange but simultaneously familiar world, forever revolted by the *unshakeable laws of nature*, ponder:

*What if...*
